    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: <strong>November 2025</strong></p>

    <p>This policy explains how Cycling Wardrobe (“we”, “us”, “the app”) collects, stores, and protects your
      information. Because kit recommendations rely on your inputs, we are deliberate about collecting only what is
      necessary and giving you full control over it.</p>

    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
    <ul class="detail-list">
      <li><strong>Wardrobe entries.</strong> Items, seasons, temperatures, notes, and any media you add.</li>
      <li><strong>Ride preferences.</strong> Typical speed, rain tolerance, intensity, saved routes, and GPX metadata
        (distance, duration, elevation) when you import a file.</li>
      <li><strong>Account data.</strong> If you create an account we store your email address to keep your wardrobe in
        sync across devices.</li>
      <li><strong>Diagnostics.</strong> Anonymous crash logs and basic usage metrics that help us debug issues—no ads or
        tracking profiles.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How we use the data</h2>
    <p>We use your information to:</p>
    <ul class="detail-list">
      <li>Generate weather-aware kit recommendations tailored to your wardrobe.</li>
      <li>Sync wardrobe items, preferences, and ride history between devices when you sign in.</li>
      <li>Respond to support requests you voluntarily send us.</li>
      <li>Improve stability through crash diagnostics.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell your information, show ads, or build advertising profiles.</p>

    <h2>Storage & security</h2>
    <p>Everything stays on your device unless you choose to sign in. If you sign in, encrypted copies are stored on our
      Supabase account hosted in the EU. All communication uses HTTPS. You can remove cloud data at any time from
      <em>Settings → Maintenance</em>.</p>

    <h2>Retention & deletion</h2>
    <ul class="detail-list">
      <li>Local data remains on device until you uninstall the app or use the “Clear data” options.</li>
      <li>Cloud data is retained while your account remains active. Delete it via the in-app Maintenance section or by
        emailing us; removal is permanent and immediate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>Cycling Wardrobe is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you
      believe a child has provided information, contact us and we will delete it.</p>

    <h2>Your rights</h2>
    <p>Wherever you live, you can:</p>
    <ul class="detail-list">
      <li>Export your wardrobe as JSON from the app.</li>
      <li>Request correction or deletion of cloud data.</li>
      <li>Withdraw consent by removing the app or signing out.</li>
    </ul>
