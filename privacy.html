    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: <strong>January 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Wardrobe data</h3>
    <p>Stored locally or synced when you sign in: item names, type, season tags, and condition flags (windproof, waterproof, thermal, etc.). No photos or media are uploaded.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Planner inputs & route data</h3>
    <p>When you use Weather Assist or the Manual Planner, we process: location input (city or coordinates), latitude/longitude from GPX files or route start points, ride inputs (temperature, wind, rain, humidity, duration, intensity, speed), GPX-derived stats (distance, elevation, estimated time), weather results and recommendations.</p>
    <p>If you sign in, we may store recent ride sessions (weather_sessions), uploaded routes and GPX metadata (routes), and generated kit recommendations (recommendations) so you can reuse routes/devices and maintain continuity across sessions.</p>

    <h3>1.3 Account data (optional)</h3>
    <p>If you create an account, we store your email address to sync wardrobe items, preferences, routes, and ride sessions across devices.</p>

    <h3>1.4 Diagnostics & telemetry</h3>
    <p>To improve stability and understand feature use, we collect planner interaction events (planner_events) and error logs (app_logs). These may include timestamps, lat/lon used in a request, route point counts, and request context. They may be linked to your account when you are signed in. We do not collect advertising IDs, third-party analytics SDKs, or behavioral profiles.</p>

    <h2>2. How we use the data</h2>
    <ul class="detail-list">
      <li>Generate kit recommendations based on your wardrobe and ride inputs.</li>
      <li>Compute weather forecasts using your chosen location or GPX route.</li>
      <li>Sync wardrobe, preferences, routes, and session history when signed in.</li>
      <li>Improve reliability via planner events and error logs.</li>
      <li>Respond to support requests you send.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not show ads, sell data, or share information for marketing.</p>

    <h2>3. Where your data goes (processing)</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Supabase (EU region)</h3>
    <p>Used for account data, synced wardrobe items, routes, GPX metadata, weather sessions, and telemetry. All communication uses HTTPS; data is encrypted at rest.</p>
    <h3>3.2 Weather API provider</h3>
    <p>To fetch forecasts, we send latitude/longitude and ride parameters to our weather provider (e.g., Open-Meteo) solely to return weather data.</p>
    <h3>3.3 Email support</h3>
    <p>If you contact support, your email may include GPX files, screenshots, or technical logs you choose to provide. We do not share data with advertisers or data brokers.</p>

    <h2>4. Storage & retention</h2>
    <h3>4.1 On your device</h3>
    <p>Wardrobe items, preferences, and planner inputs are stored locally. You can delete them via <em>Settings → Maintenance</em>.</p>
    <h3>4.2 In the cloud (if signed in)</h3>
    <p>Synced wardrobe items, routes, sessions, and recommendations remain until you delete them in-app or contact support. Telemetry/logs are retained for operations and periodically purged.</p>

    <h2>5. Your choices & rights</h2>
    <ul class="detail-list">
      <li>Use the app without an account to keep data on your device.</li>
      <li>Clear local or cloud data via <em>Settings → Maintenance</em> or by emailing support.</li>
      <li>Request access, correction, deletion, or export of cloud data.</li>
      <li>GDPR/EEA/UK: you may access, correct, delete, restrict processing, and port your data; we respond within 30 days.</li>
