    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p>Last updated: <strong>November 2025</strong></p>

    <p>By installing or using Cycling Wardrobe you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, please uninstall the app.</p>

    <h2>Use of the app</h2>
    <ul class="detail-list">
      <li>The app provides weather-aware kit recommendations. They are advisory only—you remain responsible for your
        own safety and gear choices.</li>
      <li>You must not use the app for unlawful purposes or transmit content that violates someone else’s rights.</li>
      <li>GPX files you upload must be yours or shared with permission. Do not upload routes containing sensitive or
        personal data of others.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Accounts & subscriptions</h2>
    <ul class="detail-list">
      <li>An account is optional and only needed to sync your wardrobe between devices. Keep your credentials secure.</li>
      <li>If we later offer paid features, their terms will be clearly presented before purchase.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Availability & updates</h2>
    <p>We aim for high uptime but may temporarily suspend features for maintenance, security fixes, or to comply with
      law. We may push updates automatically to keep the app stable.</p>

    <h2>Intellectual property</h2>
    <p>The Cycling Wardrobe trademarks, code, and content remain our property. You retain ownership of wardrobe entries,
      routes, and other data you contribute.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>The app is provided “as is.” To the fullest extent permitted by law we disclaim warranties of fitness and shall not
      be liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the app. Riding decisions,
      weather interpretation, and equipment choices remain yours.</p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>You may stop using the app at any time. We may suspend or terminate access if you breach these terms or abuse the
      service. Upon termination we will delete any cloud data associated with your account.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>We may revise these terms when functionality or regulation changes. Updates will be posted here with a new “Last
      updated” date. Continued use of the app constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.</p>
