    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p>Last updated: <strong>December 2024</strong></p>

    <h2>Acceptance</h2>
    <p>By installing or using Cycling Wardrobe you agree to these terms. If you disagree with any part, do not use the app.</p>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>Cycling Wardrobe provides weather-aware kit recommendations. It is advisory only—you remain responsible for interpreting the forecast and making safe gear decisions.</p>

    <h2>User responsibilities</h2>
    <ul class="detail-list">
      <li>Ensure your GPX uploads do not contain sensitive or third-party data you do not have rights to share.</li>
      <li>Keep your device secure. Anyone who accesses your phone can view your wardrobe entries.</li>
      <li>Use the latest version of the app to benefit from bug fixes and security updates.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Availability</h2>
    <p>We aim for high uptime but do not guarantee uninterrupted service. Maintenance or third-party outages (Supabase, weather APIs) may temporarily disable sync or forecasting.</p>

    <h2>Liability</h2>
    <p>We are not liable for direct or indirect damages resulting from using the app. Riding decisions, weather interpretation, and gear choices remain your responsibility.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>Questions about these terms? Email <a href="mailto:support@cyclingwardrobe.app">support@cyclingwardrobe.app</a>.</p>
